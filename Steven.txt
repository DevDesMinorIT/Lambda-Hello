My name is Steven.
Grit GRACE and Moxie... those are my words for real ladies and gentlemen.
I love to dance (was classically trained  dancer ) then Hip Hop happened and I was corrupted.
I have just come out of the eye of the storm as far as life goes I am still getting my footing and I had a move i just finished and I wanted to put it out 
there in the world that I am sorry for slowing us down but I plan on finishing and promise it only gets better. Love the energy.
